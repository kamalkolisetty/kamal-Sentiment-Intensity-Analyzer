### Sentiment Analysis Web App

This project is a web application for sentiment analysis using a pre-trained transformer model. It takes input text from the user and predicts the sentiment of the text as either negative, neutral, or positive. The sentiment prediction is displayed along with a supportive message.

#### Features:
* **Input Text:** Users can input any text for sentiment analysis.
* **Sentiment Prediction:** The web app predicts whether the input text is negative, neutral, or positive.
* **Supportive Messages:** Along with the sentiment prediction, users receive a supportive message to uplift their mood.

#### Usage:
1. Input text in the provided field.
2. Click the "Submit" button.
3. View the sentiment prediction and supportive message.

#### Technologies Used:
* **Python:** Backend programming language.
* **Flask:** Web framework for building the application.
* **Transformers:** Library for natural language processing tasks, such as tokenization and model loading.
* **HTML/CSS:** Frontend for the user interface.

#### Installation:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask app: `python app.py`
4. Access the web app in your browser: `http://localhost:5000`
